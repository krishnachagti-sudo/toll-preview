# Why the Undeposited Funds balance grows

In the worked export the Undeposited Funds balance is $7,072.74: 7 payments ($3,522.75) are over 30 days old, 2 payments of $320.00 look like the same payment entered twice, and 4 of 4 bank deposits on the statement were never recorded against the payments they hold.

## What the balance should be

Intuit describes the account as "a temporary account that holds payments you plan to deposit later at the bank". Once every bank deposit has been recorded, only payments not yet taken to the bank should be left, so the balance should be small and recent. Xenett, a review app, puts a working rule in its own words: "Any transaction older than 30 days needs investigation." That is a practitioner's rule, not an Intuit one.

The worked export, as of October 30, 2026

| Age | Items | Total |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 0 to 30 days | 7 | $3,549.99 |
| 31 to 60 days | 4 | $1,787.75 |
| 61 to 90 days | 1 | $450.00 |
| Over 90 days | 2 | $1,285.00 |
| All open items | 14 | $7,072.74 |

## Why it grows: what the worked export shows

- **Deposits never recorded.** The bank shows 4 deposits in September and October; none was recorded as a Bank Deposit, so the payments in them are still open.
- **Payments entered twice.** Two $320.00 payments with the same date, name and number #2320. If both stay, the balance is $320.00 too high.
- **Fees taken before the money arrived.** The $1,019.25 deposit matches no set exactly; a $1,050.00 payment fits after a fee.
- **Deposits matched in the bank feed instead.** An Intuit Community Manager warns that "if a bank feed deposit is then also matched separately, you could end up with a double deposit on the bank account side". The payment then stays in Undeposited Funds while the bank shows the money.
