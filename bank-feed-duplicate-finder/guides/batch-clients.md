## The summary

One account check per client, largest amount first

| Client | Platform | Pairs | High | Amount | Pattern |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Fernway Goods | QuickBooks Online | 6 | 2 | $5,163.14 | October 3, 2026 to October 21, 2026 |
| Harbourside Design | Xero | 5 | 5 | $4,708.43 | October 12, 2026 to October 16, 2026 |
| Northwind Bakery | QuickBooks Online | 6 | 4 | $3,343.13 | none |

| Tidewater Studio | Xero | 2 | 1 | $361.40 | none |

## Working through it

1. Run one check per client account: the feed lines waiting for review and the books for the month. The preview is free, so the summary costs nothing; pay for the full list only where there is something to act on.
2. Start with the largest amounts and the date-range patterns: a whole block of dates is one cause and one batch.
3. High-confidence pairs on the same day still go past the statement; medium and low ones go to the client as a question.
4. Keep a log per client: the date of the check, the pairs acted on and the exclude-ready CSV.

## What to ask the client

For each pair you cannot settle from the statement: "On this date there are two charges of this amount from this payee. Was it paid once or twice?" The answer decides whether to keep both.
