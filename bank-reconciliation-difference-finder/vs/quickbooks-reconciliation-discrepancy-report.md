# QuickBooks Reconciliation Discrepancy report vs this tool

QuickBooks Online's Reconciliation Discrepancy report lists transactions changed since your last reconciliation; this tool compares your statement with the ledger instead, so in the worked bakery month it finds a $15.00 fee and a $90.00 transposition the report would never list, while a deleted payment like the worked $642.18 one shows in both.

## When the QuickBooks report is better

- The fault is an edited or deleted transaction that was already reconciled: the report names the change and the user, which a file comparison cannot see.
- You want an answer without exporting anything.

## When this tool is

- The report is empty but the difference is not (a missing fee, a typing error, an opening entry).
- You need the reconciliation statement and the outstanding list for the file.
