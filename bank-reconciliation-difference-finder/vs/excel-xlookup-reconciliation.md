# Excel XLOOKUP reconciliation vs this tool

An XLOOKUP or COUNTIFS reconciliation on the worked month flags 4 of 13 statement lines as unmatched; this tool explains all 4 (a split deposit, a check that cleared late, a fee and a transposition) and adds the break date, for $3.00 a reconciliation against a formula sheet that is free to reuse.

|  | Excel formulas | This tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Match rule | Exact match by default (0 - Exact match. If none found, return #N/A. This is the default.); a date window needs COUNTIFS | Same amount within N days, or the same check number up to 120 days |
| Repeated amounts | First match only with XLOOKUP | Each line used once, best match first, ties flagged |
| Split deposits | No | Yes, when exactly one set fits |
| Errors | You read the zeros | Swaps, slides, sign flips, entries made twice |
| Versions | XLOOKUP is not available in Excel 2016 and Excel 2019. | Any browser |
| Cost | Free once built | $3.00 per reconciliation; preview free |

```excel
=COUNTIFS(Ledger!$C:$C,C2,Ledger!$A:$A,">="&(A2-7),Ledger!$A:$A,"<="&(A2+7))
```

## When Excel is better

- A Power Query or formula sheet you built once and reuse every month costs nothing per use and suits stable file formats.
- You want every step on a sheet your reviewer can audit cell by cell.

## When this tool is

- The zeros need explaining, not only listing.
- Formats change from client to client.
